# Salesforce Commerce Cloud integration Proof of Concept

This is the SFCC integration to Vue Storefront Next. Proof of concept means mostly that not all the data endpoints have been yet integrated. As for now we've got the:
- products browsing,
- product details,
- category listing and category browsing,
- filter, sorting, pagination,
- basic breadcrumbs feature.

In order for this integration to run, please make sure you've got the [`salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge` project installed](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge#setup). It's a required, GraphQL bridge over Salesforce CC API.

## First: GraphQL bridge installation

First, please do install the [`salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge)

To set up the application:

1. Clone the `salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge` repository:
`git clone https://github.com/DivanteLtd/salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge.git`

2. Change into the `salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge` folder:
`cd salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge`

3. Copy the `api.example.js` file located at `/packages/salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge/app/`, save it as `api.js`, and make sure `api.js` is added to your `.gitignore` file.

4. In the `api.js` file, provide values for the following variables:
<table>
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CLIENT_API_SITE_ID</code></td><td>Unique site ID (for example, RefArch or SiteGenesis).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID</code></td><td>Unique ID used exclusively for API access. See <a href="https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/topic/com.demandware.dochelp/content/b2c_commerce/topics/account_manager/b2c_account_manager_add_api_client_id.html">Add a Client API</a> for more information.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CLIENT_REALM_ID</code></td><td>Unique four-character realm ID (for example, bblx).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CLIENT_INSTANCE_ID</code></td><td>Unique instance ID within a realm (for example, 015 for an on-demand sandbox).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CLIENT_SHORT_CODE</code></td><td>Unique region-specific merchant ID (for example, staging-001).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_SESSION_SECRET</code></td><td>Unique ID for session management (for example, thisisasecretkey).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMERCE_CORS</code></td><td>Optionally enable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> for GraphQL on the defined domains (for example, enable all domains with "\*").</td></tr>
</table>

Note: You can obtain these values from your Account Executive (AE) or Customer Support Manager (CSM), except for COMMERCE_SESSSION_SECRET, which is an arbitrary unique value that you create yourself. If the COMMERCE_SESSION_SECRET key is not unique per customer application, session information can be unintentionally shared between ecommerce sites. 

5. Install dependencies:
`yarn`

6. Build the sample application:
`yarn build`

7. Start the sample application:
`yarn start:dev` (development mode) or
`yarn start` (production mode)

8. To access the GraphQL Playground, open the browser to http://localhost:3001/api

## Debug

We recommend Visual Studio Code inbuilt debugger to troubleshoot the code. The `.vscode` launch configuration is included in the repo. To debug using VSCode, see [VS Code Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

## Configuration
* You can change the logging levels by modifying the `COMMERCE_LOG_LEVEL` property in `api.js`. The supported log levels are:
    * `TRACE`
    * `DEBUG`
    * `INFO`
    * `WARN`
    * `ERROR`
    * `SILENT`
* You can also change the server listening port by changing the `port` property in `sfcc-sample-apps/packages/storefront-lwc/scripts/runtime.js`.

## Second: Vue Storefront Next setup

Vue Storefront next setup is pretty straightforward. You just need to set the proper `SFCC GraphQL Bridge` API URL by modifying the `packages/salesforce-cc-poc/theme/nuxt.config.js`:

```js
{
    // @core-development-only-end
    /* project-only-start
    ['@vue-storefront/nuxt-theme'],
    project-only-end */
    ['@vue-storefront/salesforce-cc-poc/nuxt', {
      api: {
        uri: 'https://salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge.herokuapp.com/api'
      }
    }]
}
```

Please point out this `api.url` to the address on which the `salesforce-cc-graphql-bridge` is running.

Then please do launch the `yarn dev:sfcc` to run the development mode. 

## Third: Congratulations!
Your frontend integrated with SFCC is available under the `http://localhost:3000`
